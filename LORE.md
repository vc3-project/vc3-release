# the zen of VC3
  1. every entity has to be an entity
  2. ontology matters
  3. the schema is as schema-less as possible, but no more than that.
  4. red and blue cannot be purple 
  5. a bird in the hand worth n in the cloud
  6. to keep things updated, never upgrade anything!
  7. you cannot know how to do something until you have done it
  8. solve problems with cardinality rather than complexity
  9. config, don't integrate
